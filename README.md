Our platform bridges the gap between food donors, people in need, and NGOs to ensure surplus food reaches those who need it most. Individuals and businesses can list excess food, while those in need can request assistance, allowing NGOs to coordinate collection and distribution efficiently. Additionally, we support sustainable food waste management by connecting restaurants with farmers who can repurpose food waste for composting or animal feed. Together, we can reduce food waste and fight hungerâ€”one meal at a time.
